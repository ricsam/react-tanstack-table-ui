# Building High-Performance Data Tables with Sticky Columns in React

Building data-intensive tables and data grids with many rows and columns is challenging from a performance perspective. `<ReactTanstackTableUi />` was developed specifically for excellent performance while supporting browser-native sticky columns and rows.

## Why Build Another Table Component?

Sticky columns are crucial in large datasets as they allow users to pin critical columns, maintaining context during horizontal scrolling.

When trying to build a table that is as performant as possible while scrolling, each moving element should have `position: absolute` and be translated to the correct location using `CSS transform`. Having the moving elements outside the normal document flow allows the DOM to update without causing heavy browser reflows.

However, this approach makes implementing browser-native sticky columns or rows impossible, as elements outside the normal document flow can't be sticky.

One solution to this is to implement sticky columns **on top of** the scrolling element, synchronizing scroll positions using JavaScript. This approach, while performant, may look a bit off, as there can be a latency in the sticky columns moving while scrolling vertically.

## How the Browser Handles Scroll Performance

Modern browsers use multiple threads to separate concerns:

- **Main thread**: Handles JavaScript execution, layout, styling, DOM changes, etc.
- **Compositor thread** (or rendering thread): Handles visual updates like scrolling, animations, and GPU-accelerated drawing.

Browsers aim to offload scrolling to the **compositor thread** to keep scrolling smooth—even under heavy JS computation. This offloading is why native scrolling feels fluid even when the main thread is busy: the compositor doesn't wait for JavaScript.

However, there's a catch.

If a JavaScript component (like a manually implemented sticky header or pinned column) wants to respond to a scroll event, it must **poll the scroll position from the main thread**, which introduces delay. This can result in visible desynchronization between the main table scroll and the sticky elements.

Other libraries, like **AG Grid**, often choose this JavaScript synchronization strategy. While it makes scrolling performant, it can make sticky elements feel like they move at different speeds.

## Using Native Stickiness with `<ReactTanstackTableUi />`

For `<ReactTanstackTableUi />`, the goal was to use **browser-native sticky elements** and **normal document flow**, in contrast to many other data-grid components. This strategy introduces slightly more layout overhead, but results in **perfect scroll behavior** for sticky headers and columns.

As shown in the screenshots below, scripting performance (JavaScript execution) was heavily optimized to offset the slower layout caused by this rendering strategy.

## Optimizing Scripting Performance with TanStack Table

The component uses [`@tanstack/react-table`](https://tanstack.com/table) to manage table state. However, `@tanstack/react-table` currently lacks **fine-grained re-render optimizations**.

To address this limitation:

- `<ReactTanstackTableUi />` includes a **specialized wrapper component** that monitors and consolidates props, state, and DOM updates.
- These updates are funneled into a **structured internal store** (similar to a "render model"), which computes only the changes necessary for rendering.
- The table root is rendered through a **memoized entry point** (`React.memo`) to prevent unnecessary re-renders when the parent component updates.

This results in a table that can handle complex React components in each cell, pin columns and rows natively, and scroll fluidly—while keeping the JavaScript execution as light as possible.
